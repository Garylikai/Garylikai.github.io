Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should successfully be able to:
1. Calculate and evaluate point estimators.
2. Formulate and construct confidence intervals for parameters in a statistical model, and interpret the results.
3. Formulate statistical hypotheses, construct appropriate hypothesis tests, and interpret the results.
4. Formulate linear regression models, fit these models, and interpret the results.
5. Formulate one-way ANOVA models, fit these models, and interpret the results.
6. Construct distribution-free hypothesis testing procedures and interpret the results.
