Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should successfully be able to:
1. Calculate and evaluate point estimators.
2. Formulate, construct and interpret confidence intervals about parameters in a statistical model.
3. Formulate statistical hypotheses, construct appropriate hypotheses tests and interpret results.
