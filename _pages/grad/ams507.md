Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Calculate probabilities of events by working with sets that represent them.
- Use the law of total probability and Bayesâ€™ rule to calculate probabilities of complex events.
- Use random variables and their distributions to model the outcomes of random experiments.
- Apply the general properties of the expectation and variance operators.
- Calculate cumulative  distributions,  marginal distributions, conditional distributions, and moment generating functions.
- Understand the basic convergence modes of random variables.
- Explain and use the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
