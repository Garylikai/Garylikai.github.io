Learning Outcomes

1. Learn to formulate optimization problems as linear progams.
2. Develop skill in using linear programming software, including Lindo/AMPL.
3. Understand theory from linear algebra and convex analysis that applies to the theory of linear programming.
4. Learn the simplex algorithm and use it to solve linear programs:
  - Putting linear programs in standard form with slack and excess variables;
  - Finding an initial basic feasible solution (using big M or two-phase simplex for min problems);
  - Choosing which variable enters and which variable leaves the basis;
  - Handling unbounded and infeasible problems;
  - Analyzing convergence in nondegenerate programs;
  - Analyzing convergence and methods in degenerate programs, including Bland's pivot rule, perturbation, and lexicographical methods.
5. Understand and apply principles of duality:
  - Defining dual programs;
  - Developing duality theorems;
  - Applying the dual simplex algorithm.
6. Apply sensitivity analysis to solutions of linear programs:
  - Shadow prices and reduced costs;
  - Range for objective function coefficients and right-hand sides;
  - Connections to the dual linear programs and complementary slackness.
7. Learn and use special forms of the simplex method:
  - Transportation problems;
  - Transshipment problems;
  - Assignment problems;
  - Network simplex method.
8. Other recent algorithms for linear programming:
  - Ellipsoid algorithm;
  - Karmarkar and related interior-point methods.
