Learning Outcomes

1. Demonstrate skills of working with various categorical data, including binary, nominal, ordinal and count data:
  - Expectation, variance, covariance and probability density function;
  - Point estimation with maximal likelihood method;
  - Hypothesis testing with Wald, score and likelihood ratio tests;
  - Constructing confidence intervals based on Wald, score and likelihood ratio test statistics.
2. Demonstrate skills with statistical inference for contingency tables (joint distribution of categorical variables):
  - Difference of proportions, relative risk and odds ratio;
  - Chi-squared tests;
  - Fisherâ€™s exact test;
  - McNemar test for matched pairs.
3. Demonstrate skills with statistical modeling for binary/nominal/ordinal response:
  - Build and apply logistic regression, baseline category and cumulative logit models;
  - Maximal likelihood fitting and goodness of fit tests;
  - Model diagnostic and model selection;
  - Other link functions: log-log, complementary log-log.
4. Demonstrate skills with statistical modeling for count data:
  - Build and apply log-linear models;
  - Connection between log-linear and logit models;
  - Model fitting and goodness of fit tests;
  - Association graphs and collapsibility.
5. Demonstrate skills with proficient usage of standard statistical software tools for categorical data analysis:
  - Understanding of the assumptions, derivation and interpretation of results from statistical analysis;
  - Proficient in SAS<sup>&reg;</sup> procedures: FREQ, GENMOD, GLM and LOGISTIC.
