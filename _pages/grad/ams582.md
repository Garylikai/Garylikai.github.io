Learning Outcomes

1. Extend knowledge of probability theory.
  - Central chi-square and central F-distributions;
  - Non-central chi-square and non-central F-distributions;
  - Multiple comparisons procedures including Bonferroni’s inequality, Scheffe’s multiple comparison procedures, and Tukey’s multiple comparison procedures;
  - Decomposing chi-square sums of squares;
  - Expected value and variance of sums of squares.
2. Learn classical statistical designs:
  - One-way layout;
  - Randomized block designs;
  - Latin squares, Graeco-Latin squares, hyper Graeco-Latin squares including designs with replications;
  - Two and three way layouts;
  - $2^k$ designs;
  - Random effect models;
  - Mixed models.
3. Power and sample size computations.
4. Learn the statistical computing package of the student’s choice and apply it to obtain the statistical model that generated a set of synthetic data.
