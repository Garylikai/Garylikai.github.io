**AMS 583: Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis**

Longitudinal data takes the form of repeated measurements of the same subject (humans, animals, plants, samples, etc) over time (or other conditions). This type of data has a broad range of applications, including public health, medical research, pharmaceutical studies, life sciences, agriculture, engineering and physical sciences.  Longitudinal data analysis allows one to study the changes in mean response over time and answer other scientific questions pertaining to the relationship between the response and time.  This course aims to introduce statistical models and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data.  Both the classical (univariate and multivariate repeated analysis of variance) and more recent approaches (1) general linear models for correlation, random coefficient models, linear mixed effect models for normal repeated measurements; (2) generalized linear models for non-normal response and population-averaged models (generalized estimating equations) for non-normal repeated measurements, of analyzing longitudinal data be covered in this course.
