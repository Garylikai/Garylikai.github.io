**AMS 587: Nonparametric Statistics**

This course covers the applied nonparametric statistical procedures: one-sample Wilcoxon tests, two-sample Wilcoxon tests, runs test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Hodges-Lehman estimation, Friedman analysis of variance on ranks. The course gives the theoretical underpinnings to these procedures, showing how existing techniques may be extended and new techniques developed. An excursion into the new problems of multivariate nonparametric inference is made.
