**AMS 588: Failure and Survival Data Analysis**

This course introduces both parametric and non-parametric statistical models for analysis of the failure and survival data â€“ a critical topic in quantitative finance, econometrics, and biostatistics. Different censoring mechanisms will be discussed. The course will mainly cover Kaplan-Meier estimator for characterizing the distribution of the failure and survival data, non-parametric log-rank test for comparing multiple groups, and the accelerated failure time model and Cox regression model uncovering various predictor/explanatory variables to survival/failure. Applications to finance, economics and biomedicine will be illustrated. Topics include basic life table construction, estimation of selected hazards models, and discussion of various problems associated with hazards models analysis.
