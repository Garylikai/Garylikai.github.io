**AMS 598: Big Data Analysis**

This course introduces the application of the supercomputing to statistical data analyses, particularly on big data. Implementations of various statistical methodologies within parallel computing framework are demonstrated through all lectures. The course will cover (1) parallel computing basics, including architecture on interconnection networks, communications methodologies, algorithm and performance measurements, and (2) their applications to modern data mining techniques, including modern variable selection/Dimension reduction, linear/logistical regression, tree-based classification methods, Kernel-based methods, non-linear statistical models, and model inference/Resampling methods.
