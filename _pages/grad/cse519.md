**CSE 519: Data Science Fundamentals**

Data Science is a rapidly emerging discipline at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and mathematical modeling. This course is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to Data Science by challenging student groups to build predictive models for upcoming events, and validating their models against the actual outcomes. This course will cover the building blocks of data science from managing the data itself to algorithmic and analytical techniques. Specific topics include data preparation, exploratory data analysis, statistics, visualization, optimization, unstructured data, distributed analyses.
