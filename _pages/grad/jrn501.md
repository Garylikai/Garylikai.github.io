**JRN 501: Foundations of Science Communication I**

In this team-taught, immersive science communication training, students will build skills to passionately communicate in a way that excites, engages, and encourages audiences to want to learn more about their work. Improvisational theater-based techniques are combined with message design strategies like distilling and storytelling, enabling healthcare professionals, scientists, and researchers to use strategy and spontaneity to execute powerful communication in any context. Rather than focusing on teaching tips, learning through experience and reflection are integral to the Alda Method&reg;. This interactive, immersive approach helps students focus on engaging in clear and vivid communication that
ensures their science is communicated with integrity and accuracy. This leads to improved understanding by the public, media, patients, elected officials, and others outside of their own discipline.
