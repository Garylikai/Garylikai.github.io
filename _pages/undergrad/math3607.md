**MATH 3607: Beginning Scientific Computing**

Introduction to mathematical theory of algorithms used to solve problems that typically arise in sciences, engineering, and finance. Math 3607 is a course which has three main goals: it introduces students to MATLAB (or improves their knowledge of MATLAB); it uses MATLAB to solve practical problems from various areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, business, and finance; and it presents the numerical analysis needed to use MATLAB effectively. The principle underlying this course is that the way to learn MATLAB and numerical analysis is by doing it, not by reading about it. This course is taught in a computer lab and MATLAB will be used to some extent every class.
