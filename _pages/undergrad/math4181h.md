**MATH 4181H: Honors Analysis I**

4181H and 4182H is an enriched honors sequence introducing students to mathematical underpinnings of calculus. 4181H is the first of the calculus sequence designed to introduce
students to the mathematical underpinnings of analysis. 4182H is a continuation with a rigorous treatment of multivariable calculus including gradients, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals, Green’s theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes’ Theorem. This two-semester sequence comprises the most intensive first year honors track in mathematics. It is designed to challenge talented, highly motivated students, regardless of their chosen major area of study. The courses introduce students to the mathematical underpinnings of calculus and stimulate the development of mathematical thinking, in addition to covering the material of the traditional calculus sequence. The sequence is taught by faculty members in small sections with considerable teacherstudent interaction.
